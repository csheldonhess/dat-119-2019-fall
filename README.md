# Some of the lessons and files for DAT-119, Python 1, Fall 2019

## Table of contents:


I'd like to thank Elizabeth Wickes for use of [her online learning objects](https://github.com/elliewix/IS-452-Fall2018), which form the basis of the (modified/remixed) notebooks found here. Where I refer to a textbook, it's Deitel & Deitel's [Python for Computer Science and Data Science](https://www.pearson.com/nl/en_NL/higher-education/subject-catalogue/computer-science/Deitel-Intro-to-Python.html).

License: Elizabeth's work is CC-BY, with a request that you let her know if you're using her materials. I'll go with that, too: CC-BY, and give me a heads up.  

If you're *teaching* DAT-119 at CCAC North in Spring 2020 (and you aren't me), you are explicitly disallowed from reusing anything in this repository. *Students* are always, at any time, welcome to refer to these items, no matter when or where they are taking Python! For the sake of academic honesty and not getting in trouble with your professors, always cite code you borrow, but I put my notebooks and homework assignments up in order to be helpful to students. I hope students find it and get value from it!

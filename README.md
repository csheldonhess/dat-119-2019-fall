I'd like to thank Elizabeth Wickes for use of [her online learning objects](https://github.com/elliewix/IS-452-Fall2018), which form the basis of the (modified/remixed/sometimes reimagined) notebooks found here. Where I refer to a textbook, it's Deitel & Deitel's [Python for Computer Science and Data Science](https://www.pearson.com/nl/en_NL/higher-education/subject-catalogue/computer-science/Deitel-Intro-to-Python.html).

License: Elizabeth's work is CC-BY, with a request that you let her know if you're using her materials. I'll go with that, too: **CC-BY, and let me know you're using it to teach**; I'll give Elizabeth a heads up, too. A bonus, for any teacher who chooses to get in touch: I'll share with you my midterm project (not shared online, so it remains a surprise for any students who might want to time themselves while working on it) and my most current homework solutions.

Students are welcome to refer to these items, no matter when or where they are taking Python! For the sake of academic honesty and not getting in trouble with your professors, **always cite any code you borrow**, but you do not have to let me know that you're accessing these materials. 

For anyone&mdash;students, teachers, whoever&mdash;if you have questions or comments, feel free to get in touch: csheldon-hess at ccac dot edu.

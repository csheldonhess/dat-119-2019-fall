# Some of the lessons and files for DAT-119, Python 1, Fall 2019

## Table of contents:


I'd like to thank Elizabeth Wickes for use of [her online learning objects](https://github.com/elliewix/IS-452-Fall2018), which form the basis of the (modified/remixed) notebooks found here. Where I refer to a textbook, it's Deitel & Deitel's [Python for Computer Science and Data Science](https://www.pearson.com/nl/en_NL/higher-education/subject-catalogue/computer-science/Deitel-Intro-to-Python.html).

License: Elizabeth's work is CC-BY, with a request that you let her know if you're using her materials. I'll go with that, too: CC-BY, and give me a heads up.  

If you're teaching DAT-119 at CCAC North in Spring 2020, you are explicitly disallowed from using these notebooks.

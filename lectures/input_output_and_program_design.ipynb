    "Designing your program is more important than coding it. Before you write a single line of code, you should know what your program is going to do. What are your requirements for the program? What are your **inputs**, your **outputs**, and the processes that need to happen in between? What steps will the program need to take?\n",
    "\n",
    "When you plan, you write down (I mean that: physically write it down!) the **algorithm** you want your program to follow. The book's definition of \"algorithm\" is fine, but this one is simpler and easier to remember: \"a step-by-step method of solving a problem.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The book is really keen on flowcharts, and there are definitely people who use those to reason through programming-type problems. [Here is a nice example of a decision-making flowchart.](https://technologyrediscovery.net/coursesGen/grades/gradeCards_fa18.html#flow) - This one wasn't used to make a program, but you can see how it could have been.\n",

    "* [Here is one answer for the set of code blocks](img/code_blocks_maze.png).\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative to flow charts is pseudocode, which the textbook gives you formal-looking language for, but honestly? It's just writing out the steps in your own language, before you try to code them into the computer. If you prefer to think with flow charts, that is excellent; if you prefer to write out your steps, that is also excellent. As long as you make a plan before you start coding, I'm happy."

Functions represent our third control flow manipulation mechanism, giving us the power to jump from place to place in our program and to repeat code blocks with even more finesse than loops allowed.\n",

    "* __call a function__:  this is when you actually call the function to execute, and you do this via `name()` somewhere in your code\n",
    "* __parameters/arguments__:  these are the values you want to give the function when you call it, you can have 0 parameters/arguments (technically, \"parameters\" are what you create when you define the function, and \"arguments\" are what you use when you call it, but only really frustrating people will ever give you trouble for using the terms interchangeably)\n",
    "* __'passing' values__: this is how you give the function the parameters it needs to give you values back; passing means that the value is handed off in the system such that it can be saved and processed.  This is different from printing values, which just spits the value out to the console and you can capture and save that value.\n",

There are also modules with specialized functions that we import and use for specific tasks as we need them.  \n",

    "\n",
    "Functions can theoretically contain any piece of code, which means that people use them in a wide variety of styles and purposes.  There are books and many opinions on best practices for how to craft and use functions, so there's a lot of room for creativity.  This means that the structure of defining a function won't dictate to you how it should be used, so a lot of the work is your responsibility to keep yourself in line.\n",
    "\n",
    "When starting out with functions, think about elements that you might want to repeat over and over.  You can put all that code into a function, and then you just have to call the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might also want to use a function when your code is getting very long and you are having a hard time following what is going on in your program.

    "In this kind of case, we can first try to snip out the longest chunk of processing code and put that into a function.  You could also consider making each of these a separate function, processing each level of granularity.\n",

In this case, all the processing work has been sent out to `get_records` and `process_record`, so this might be all the code there is in the main processing section of our program.  This can make the control flow easier to understand because all the processing and data manipulation elements have been isolated. \n",

    "1. _Thinking_ phase (for the humans)\n",
    "    * This is another 'hands off the keyboard' phase where you sit and think through everything about the function. You need to think about the purpose of the function, names, inputs, outputs, and intended actions.<br><br>\n",
    "2. _Defining_ phase\n",
    "    * This is where the function is defined in your code (how exactly we do that is the next section).  Functions are usually defined in the beginning of your script, although this isn't required.  You're going to write code according to the specifications that you determined in phase 1.  Maybe there will be more questions you can't ask until you start the coding process, but the larger questions need to be answered in phase 1, before getting here.\n",
    "    * Once a function is defined, Python justs knows what's there. **If all you've done is define a function, none of the code inside of it has been executed yet.**  \n",
    "    * This definition must happen **before** you call the function. (Because I do not like to lie to you, I'll admit: there are exceptions which are outside of the scope of this lesson, and you do not need to worry about them.) <br><br>\n",
    "3.  _Calling_ phase\n",
    "    * Now that Python has learned about the function, you can make it actually execute the code. You do this by calling the function. \n",
    "    \n",
    "There are entire books around how to format and design functions.  I'm going to give you some clear starter directions that will serve you well for this class, but be prepared as you keep going in Python that you'll see some other traditions.  There are many potentially cool things you can do with functions, but it's best to start off simple.  Then we can explore extra goodies."

They are built into Python's standard library and have already been implemented for us by the creators of the Python language.\n",

    "    1. what do you want to name the function?\n",

    "        * consider maybe using verbs (action words) for your function names\n",

    "        * This is your 'do stuff' step.\n",
    "    4. what should the function return? or: what should the function give back to you\n",
    "        * While you can choose to not return something, we won't usually be doing that.\n",
    "            - If you don't return something, your function probably has some other kind of **side effect** (fancy CS term for \"something happened, but it wasn't a return value\"), like changing a global variable (no, _don't do this_) or printing something to the console.\n",
    "        * You must pick one and only one object to return. I know the book talked about returning multiple things, but we'll generally be sticking to returning a single string or a number or a Boolean for the time being.\n",
    "2. **Defining phase** (remember that this phase only teaches Python about your function.  None of the code in the body of the function has actually been executed after this phase).\n",
    "    1. Add the `def` block line in, providing the function name you chose.\n",
    "        * So you'll have `def my_function():` thus far\n",
    "    2. Add the parameter variables into the `()` of the def block\n",
    "        * Give these sensible names that you'll remember later, do not just use x and y.\n",
    "        * You will provide these in the order that they should be provided when calling the function, with the variable names separated by commas.  Leave the `()` empty if you aren't requiring that the function take any input.\n",
    "        * So you'll have `def my_function(thing1, thing2):` at this point\n",
    "    3. Inside the function definition block (so indented under the `def` line), add your do stuff items.\n",
    "        * So you'll have \n",

    "            some_local_variable = some operation involving thing1 + thing2, probably\n",

    "    4. Add your return statement (probably)\n",
    "        * this is a separate step because it will always come last in your function.\n",
    "        * it should always come last because your function execution will immediately stop as soon as Python hits a `return` statement.\n",
    "        * `return` is a keyword and not a function, so there aren't any `()`.  Provide the single object that you want to return after the keyword.  Do not actually add multiple items after this separated by commas; it wasn't nice of the book to show you that right now.   \n",
    "        * So you'll have \n",

    "        ```\n",
    "     5. **Your function is not finished unless there is a comment** saying what it does and, ideally, describing what its inputs (parameters) and outputs (return value or side effects) should be.\n",
    "3. **Calling phase** (now is the time to make the code actually work.  When you call the function you are finally asking Python to execute the code now).\n",
    "    1. Somewhere later in your code, you'll call the function with the function's name and `()`.  You'll add this inside `main()` (more on that in a bit), and not inside your function definition. \n",
    "    2. Provide the arguments in the `()` according to how you defined it.  So if you said `def student(name, age):`, then you must provide those values in that order, a name _then_ an age. \n",
    "    3.  Choose where you want the returned results to go. Right now, you essentially have two choices:  print it or save it to a variable.  I suggest saving it to a variable, that way you have the value to mess with later.\n",

    "\n",
    "So now you want to make a function.  Here are some brief steps to making that happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. After the thinking phase, **use some code comments to describe what you want to do**.  Answer what the name is going to be, what it will do (using your own words), and describe in detail or give an example of the output.\n",
    "2. Decide where you should define your function.  Function definitions generally go in the top of your code, just after your import statements (more on importing in a moment).  You may eventually end up with a chunk of your script that has many functions within it.  For now, **put your function definitions just after your import statements.**  If you have multiple, the order doesn't really matter at this point. Scoot your code comments from step one up here, too.\n",
    "3.  Start your definition block. (see notes below on what this looks like).\n",
    "    * Give it the name that you chose in your thinking phase.\n",
    "    * For now, set this to accept one parameter, and call it test.\n",
    "4.  In the first round through, I don't want you to worry about doing anything cool in your function.\n",
    "    * So in the block of your function, the only thing that I want you to have here is `return test`\n",
    "    * What we're doing here is strictly testing the input/output of your function.  Sort of the equivalent of \"Can I get the water to run through the sink?\" Only once you've established that, yes, the water will come in from the faucet and leave through the drain, can you start thinking about washing dishes.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * At this point your function should look only like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ``` python\n",
    "    def the_name_you_want(test):\n",
    "        return test\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    Seriously, that's it.\n",
    "5. Add your function call where you need to use it.\n",
    "    * Pass in a test input or just a string.\n",
    "    * Put your function call into a `print()` statement so you can see the output.\n",
    "    * So you should have added something like:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ``` python\n",
    "    print(the_name_you_want(\"just testing\"))\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "6. Run your code, checking to see that what you've put in the input is coming out and there aren't any errors coming up.\n",
    "7. Now that you've proved that you can send data away and get it back, start actually writing the content of your function.\n",
    "    * redo the input parameters, removing `test` and adding what you really need.\n",

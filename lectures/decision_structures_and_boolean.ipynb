    "Boolean expressions and conditional checks\n",
    "=====================================\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the code we've written up to this point runs in the order we put it in, line by line, with every line being executed. That's a fine way to solve a lot of problems, but we live in a world of uncertainty, right? Sometimes we need a program to act differently based on variations in the inputs our users might give it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter Booleans.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally speaking, Booleans allow us to make decision statements. We can use this to check inputs, create more complex algorithms, and perform data filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's review an essential concept:  the expression. Expressions are valid pieces of code that evaluate to a value. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `2 + 2` evaluates to `4`\n",
    "* `8 % 2` evaluates to `0`\n",
    "\n",
    "Crafting a decision statement requires that you create a **Boolean expression**. These may also be called \"**conditional checks**.\" They are expressions that evaluate to either `True` or `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Boolean is both a concept (logic, etc) and a data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **bool**: this is a data type, representing the two logical objects\n",
    "    * **`True`** and **`False`**: these are the two Boolean objects available in Python; note that capitalization matters\n",
    "* __conditional check__: this is an expression will end up as `True` or `False`.  Examples will be anything that has the `==` in it, or a method/function that returns a `True` or `False`. You can also use `!=` to indicate 'not equal to'.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you think back to the code.org exercises we did at the beginning of the semester, we used `if` statements there:\n",
    "* `if path to the right`\n",
    "* `if path ahead, do ... else ...` \n",
    "\n",
    "Crafting a Boolean expression\n",
    "========================\n",
    "\n",
    "Boolean expressions evaluate to either `True` or `False`, and there are several ways to create them.  The two primary ways are using an operator (math looking thing) or a method/function (including a custom function that you write ... soon, but not today!) specifically designed to return a Boolean value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Core Boolean operators\n",
    "----------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "* `==` (read as \"double equals\")  this is the equality check operator, which should appear between two objects and will return either `True` or `False`, e.g.: \n",
    "    * `1 == 1` will return `True`\n",
    "    * `2 == 4` will return `False`\n",
    "    * Important:  this will check equivalence and not object identity. This is a concept that we will not really be covering too heavily. But you may see the `is` keyword, which will check identity. This may appear to be functionally equivalent, but that is not the case. You'll learn more about `is` later.\n",
    "* `!=` (read as \"not equals\") this is the inverse of the equality check operator.\n",
    "    * `1 == 1` will return `False`\n",
    "    * `2 == 4` will return `True` \n",
    "    \n",
    "Then the usual math suspects:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `>` (greater than)\n",
    "* `<` (less than)\n",
    "* `<=` (less than or equal to)\n",
    "* `>=` (greater than or equal to) \n",
    "\n",
    "There is an important distinction between the `greater/less than` and the `greater/less than or equal to` operators. Example: 10 is not less than 10, but it is equal to it. So if you were trying to check if something is a number up to or including 10, you need to use `num <= 10`. This is functionally equivalent to `num < 11`.  You will develop your own personal style.\n",
    " \n",
    "    \n",
    "General steps for writing conditional statements\n",
    "=======================================\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Figure out the Boolean expression that tests what your truth is.* Pay attention to the language of the question in your head (or in your planning document) and try to match that. Experiment with this expression on your data or a representative sample of the data, printing out the Boolean results to do an eyeball spot check.\n",
    "2. Add that expression into an `if` block\n",
    "3. Add bits and bobs as necessary\n",
    "\n",
    "**One of the most common errors in constructing boolean checks is inversing what you are checking for. Check for what you want. Do not check for what you do not want.**\n",
    "    \n",
    "# the `if` block\n",
    "\n",
    "Your first step is to figure out the Boolean expression that you want to be checking. Once you have that, you can place it into your `if` block.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This `if` block must appear once and at the beginning of every decision structure. You can add stuff after it, but we'll look at it alone first.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a one-way check. You will provide it a Boolean expression, and the code in the `if` block will be executed if that expression evaluates to `True`. Nothing will happen if the condition evaluates to `False`. We'll explore how we can build off this `if` block later, but we need to get this down first.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `if` - this is your base keyword that every conditional check that will open with, and you may only use this once at the very beginning. You have to pass this a conditional check.  Example usage:\n",
    "    * ```python\n",
    "    if boolean_expression:\n",
    "        # stuff to do if the conditional check is True```\n",
    "        \n",
    "We're going to work on a program that checks if a child's height is within limits for a roller coaster ride.  All passengers must be 34 inches or above.\n",
    "\n",
    "All conditional checks require 3 pieces:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  The thing being cheked, usually this is your variable\n",
    "2.  The thing to check it against\n",
    "3.  How do you want to check it?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's answer this for our current problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  We want to check the child's height in the variable: `height_of_child_inches`\n",
    "2.  We want to check that against the minimum height of 34 inches\n",
    "3.  This in inclusive, so anyone 34 inches or taller height can ride.  So we have `>=`\n",

    "Putting these three together, we have:\n",

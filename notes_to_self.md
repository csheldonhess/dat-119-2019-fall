###Notes to Coral about things to change for next time:
* Fix up the command line lesson - handout instead of slides.
* Take out "exceptions" from the "files and exceptions" notebook. You never make it through that part.
* Work on breaking up the long texty intros with more concrete examples, especially in the repetition structures notebook.
* Maybe create a NumPy/Pandas homework? (Probably not.)

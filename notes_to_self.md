# Notes to Coral about things to change for next time:
* Maybe add a partial module about rewriting requirements in students' own words, to help with the planning doc process?
* Fix up the command line lesson - handout instead of slides.
* Take out "exceptions" from the "files and exceptions" notebook. You never make it through that part.
* Work on breaking up the long texty intros with more concrete examples, especially in the repetition structures notebook.
* Maybe create a NumPy/Pandas homework? (Probably not.)

## Homeworks to completely redo
* Word count in the Raven (it's in Chegg, and I'm furious)
* Letter count in a dictionary (it's too much like one of Dr. Chuck's examples, I guess? half the class copied code from Dr. Chuck)

## Homeworks to clean up
* Maybe make the code.org more collaborative? Spend more time talking about it in class, anyway, because students aren't all making the jump from this to a planning document
